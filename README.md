# SOEN-6011-project
Name : Dhruviben Jigeshkumar Modi
Function 4 : Gamma Function
Student ID : 40166396

Project Description : This is a medium-sized scientific software engineering project with the following characteristics: it is to be pursued from first principles, it has an injection of certain elements of agile methodologies and DevOps, it includes a number of activities resulting in a number of artifacts, treats documenting, versioning, and testing as ‘first- class’ citizens, and it involves individual work only.

Gammma Function : In mathematics, the gamma function (represented by Γ, the capital letter gamma from the Greek alphabet) is one commonly used extension of the factorial function to complex numbers. The gamma function is defined for all complex numbers except the non-positive integers. For any positive integer n, Γ(n) = (n - 1)! and For real numbers x > 0 it uses Striling's aapproximation.

This project is implemented using Java programing language, source code is compatible with Eclipse IDE and intelliJ IDE.

Instructions to execute : Code can be executed using command line interface, To execute a program run gammaFunction.java.

Requirement for test cases : All the separated modules are tested using JUnit 5 library and to test the coverage of test cases run gammaFunctionTest.java.

All of the individual problems and report file is found in GammaFunction4 folder. Latex files can be compiled in Overleaf or MiKTex Latex editor.
